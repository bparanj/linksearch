## Copy SSH Credentials to Clipboard

Customize the JSON data in ssh.json for your needs and open ssh.html in a browser to start using the search and copy to clipboard feature.

### Dependencies

- Tippy
- Popper

## Search Hyperlinks

Customize the JSON data in bookmark.json for your needs and open bookmark.html in a browser to start using the search and open link in new tab feature.

The bookmark link is dynamically bound to a variable using Aline bind directive.

# Tasks

- Make both fields use copyToClipboard function, see if the magic methods can be deleted.
- Start at loops.html to see how add works
- Setup paid Tailwind to make landing.html work
		Use PostCSS and npm to setup landing.html
- Refer model.html and see how to add input text field to the color dropdown. Add the new color to the dropdown if Add button is clicked.
		Identify the data. colors: Red, Green, Blue etc
		Identify the behavior. add a new color to colors array on Add button click
		Display the data. Loop through the colors and display the colors in the dropdown.
		The new component will be a combination of basic binding and select code snippets in model.html

- Purine levels in foods (low, moderate, high). Sort by purine level.

## Nice to Haves

- Customize bookmark.html.
- In ssh.html, on hitting enter display the results table and allow copy of command and password.
- Fix the flicker when pressing escape to clear the text field. 
- Pressing escape once should clear the text field. Currently you have to hit escape twice.
- On selecting a result row, clear the text field.
- Use https://www.npmjs.com/package/convert-csv-to-json npm package to convert CSV file to JSON

# Code Snippets

## Remove Pairs

For removing unwanted key-value pair in a list of JSON objects:

```javascript
for(var i = 0; i < data.length; i++) {
	delete data[i]['year'];
}
```

View the result:

```
console.log(data)
console.table(data)
```

Right click on the data object and click Copy object in Javascript console.

## CSV to JSON Converter

```javascript
let csvToJson = require('convert-csv-to-json');

let fileInputName = 'test.csv'; 
let fileOutputName = 'test.json';

csvToJson.fieldDelimiter(',')
csvToJson.generateJsonFileFromCsv(fileInputName, fileOutputName);
```

# Inventive Principles Used

| Principle        | Description |
| ---------------  | ----------- |
| Segmentation     | Divide a system or object into separate independent parts or sections. Make a system modular so that it becomes easy to put together and take apart   |
| Merging     		 | Merge in space - Merge related object to work together in space. HTML centric development.   |
| Nested Doll      | Allow one object to pass through an appropriate hole in another. Alpine directives.   |
| Prior Action     | Perform a useful action (either fully or partly) before it is needed. 70 to 90 percent reuse of code.   |
| Other Way Around | Turn the process upside down. Declarative style code in HTML.   |
| Dynamize     		 | Split a system into parts that are capable of moving relative to each other. CSS and Javascript libraries can be easily integrated.   |
| Partial or Excessive Action | If an action is difficult and can be easily done in future, better do it less or partial. Use the customized starter templates for new features.|
