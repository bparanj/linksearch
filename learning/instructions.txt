Here is an example of how you can add a custom drop-down list to TinyMCE:

This code initializes TinyMCE with the lists plugin, and adds a custom button to the toolbar with the title "Custom Dropdown List". The button is defined as a splitbutton type, which allows you to display a drop-down menu when you click on the button. The menu contains three options, and each option inserts a different piece of content into the editor when selected.

You can add additional options to the drop-down list by adding more objects to the menu array. You can also change the title, icon, and behavior of the button by modifying the title, icon, and onAction properties.

In this HTML code, the TinyMCE JavaScript library is included in the header section, and the custom drop-down list functionality is defined in the script tag. The text area that will be transformed into a TinyMCE editor is defined in the body section of the HTML code.

When the HTML code is loaded in a web browser, the TinyMCE editor will be initialized, and the custom drop-down list button will be added to the toolbar, allowing you to insert content into the editor by selecting an option from the drop-down list.
