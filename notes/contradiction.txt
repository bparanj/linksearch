Is it possible to have physical contradiction in software?

In TRIZ, a physical contradiction is a situation in which two or more conflicting characteristics are required of a system, but it is not possible for all of them to be simultaneously satisfied. The concept of physical contradiction is often used in the context of engineering and physical systems, where it is relatively easy to identify and understand the conflicting characteristics.

In software development, it is less common to think in terms of physical contradictions, but it is possible to have conflicts between different requirements or constraints that cannot be simultaneously satisfied. For example, a software system may have a requirement for high performance, but also a requirement for low power consumption. These are two conflicting characteristics that cannot be simultaneously satisfied.

In these cases, TRIZ can still be applied to identify and resolve the conflicts. The key is to identify the conflicting characteristics and then use the tools and methods of TRIZ to find creative solutions that overcome or eliminate the conflict. For example, by using a different algorithm or data structure that is more efficient, it may be possible to improve performance while still reducing power consumption.

It is worth noting that in software development, the concept of contradiction may also be extended to other types such as functional, dynamic, and geometric.

When designing a UI, we have physical contradiction such as Button must be present and Button must be absent because too many buttons lead to a confusing UI. Is my understanding correct?

Yes, that is a correct example of a physical contradiction in UI design. On one hand, buttons are necessary for users to interact with the interface, but having too many buttons can lead to a cluttered and confusing interface. This creates a trade-off between having the necessary functionality and presenting a clean, simple design. The goal in resolving this contradiction is to find a balance between the conflicting requirements to create an effective and user-friendly interface.

Earlier you said physical contradictions are not found in software development. Is that right?

My apologies for the confusion, physical contradictions can indeed arise in software development as well, such as the example you mentioned about having a button present and absent at the same time. However, the nature of physical contradictions in software is typically different from those in the physical world and their resolution may require different methods and approaches. The field of software development has its own specific contradictions and methods for resolving them, such as usability vs functionality, performance vs scalability, and so on.

How to resolve the button contradiction?

The resolution of a physical contradiction in the context of UI design typically involves identifying a solution that meets the conflicting requirements in a new and innovative way. One approach is to consider alternative designs or user interaction patterns that address the problem. For example, instead of having a physical button, the functionality could be triggered by a gesture or voice command. Another approach is to use an adaptive UI that dynamically changes the visibility or accessibility of buttons based on the user's context or interaction history. Ultimately, the resolution of a physical contradiction requires creativity and a deep understanding of the problem and the user's needs.

What is the general form of a physical contradiction?

In TRIZ, a physical contradiction is a situation in which two or more conflicting characteristics are required of a system, but it is not possible for all of them to be simultaneously satisfied. The general form of a physical contradiction is represented by the following equation:

P1(x1) ≠ P2(x2)

Where:

P1 and P2 are two conflicting characteristics or properties of the system.
x1 and x2 are the corresponding values or levels of the characteristics.
The inequality sign ≠ indicates that it is not possible for P1 and P2 to have the same value or level.
For example, if a system requires high strength and low weight, but it is not possible to increase one without decreasing the other, this would be a physical contradiction.

P1 = strength
P2 = weight
x1 = high
x2 = low

This equation can be used to represent any physical contradiction, as long as the conflicting characteristics and their values are defined. Once the physical contradiction is identified, TRIZ can be used to find a solution that overcomes or eliminates the conflict.

What is the difference between technical contradiction and physical contradiction?

In TRIZ, a technical contradiction is a situation in which two or more conflicting technical requirements or constraints are present in a system, but it is not possible to simultaneously satisfy all of them. A physical contradiction, on the other hand, is a situation in which two or more conflicting physical characteristics or properties of a system are present, but it is not possible to simultaneously satisfy all of them.

The main difference between the two is that technical contradictions relate to technical requirements or constraints, while physical contradictions relate to physical characteristics or properties of a system.

For example, a technical contradiction may occur in a software system when there is a requirement for high performance but also a requirement for low power consumption. These are two conflicting technical requirements that cannot be simultaneously satisfied.

A physical contradiction may occur in a product design when there is a requirement for high strength but also a requirement for low weight. These are two conflicting physical characteristics that cannot be simultaneously satisfied.

Both technical and physical contradictions can be resolved using the tools and methods of TRIZ. However, the process of identifying and resolving the contradictions may be slightly different, depending on whether the contradiction is technical or physical.

Physical Contradiction in Software
 The web app began with a simple UI with no buttons on the home page. After a few years, it had lot of buttons, similar to how Microsoft Word looks like. Not so good! How to design a product that is having the buttons and at the same time not having any buttons but provides all the features we need? Can we remove all the buttons to make the design simple and at the same time provide business value?

The general form of physical contradiction looks like:

X must have A and X must have -A

The thing X must have some property and the opposite property. We can break this contradiction by asking:

1. Do we need both A and -A at the same time?

2. Do we need both A and -A in the same space?

In the web app design case, we can choose the time as a way to separate the opposing properties. We can apply the Separation in Time principle to resolve this physical contradiction.

The design must be modified by removing all the buttons or as many buttons as possible on the home page. The button should appear only when the context is right during the use of the product. One of the reasons why the product became messy page with many buttons is that the app was very CRUD based.

It lacked clear messaging to the users when using the product and did not provide any next action to take during the workflow. By making the messages actionable, we can include the links that provides them a clear action to take to complete their task.
